== C. Good quality abstract

Same as above here, a guidance documentation should be provided and
established. What is the existing guidance source: WMO Guidance to be
added

Well know bad templates for abstract should be flagged to be gradually
replaced. For instance the automatically generated bulletin records
should be replaced by records having a valid description. This can be
easily detected automatically and referenced. EDX01 BUFR bulletin
available from EUMP (EUMETSAT - DARMSTADT) Satellite Centre EUMETSAT
Darmstadt - EUMETSAT - The bulletin is coded as BUFR code form: FM 94
(BUFR, Binary universal form for the >representation of meteorological
data) . (Refer to WMO No.306 - Manual on Codes for the >definition of
WMO international codes) - The IEDX01 TTAAii Data Designators decode (2)
as: T1 >(I): Observational data (Binary coded) - BUFR. A2 (X): Global
Area (area not definable). (2: Refer to >WMO No.386 - Manual on the GTS
- Attachment II.5) - WMO No.9 - Volume C1 `Remarks' field: >IASI
